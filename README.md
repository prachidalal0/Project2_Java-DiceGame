## Description:  
This project involves the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for a poker dice game, using JavaFX to handle the GUI elements and Java for the application logic. The application allows users to roll virtual dice and displays the outcome in a visually appealing manner, simulating a real dice-rolling experience. 

The program is designed to take user input for the number of dice and the type of dice to roll (such as standard 6-sided dice). The game also includes a reset button to clear the results and start a new roll. The system supports multiple dice rolls at once, and results are displayed with dynamic updates to the graphical interface.

## Technologies Used:  
- Java  
- JavaFX (for GUI elements)  
- Scene Builder (optional, if used for UI design)  
- [Any other relevant technologies or libraries used]  

## Key Features:  
- **Customizable Dice Roll**: Users can select how many dice to roll and the number of sides on each dice.
- **Interactive GUI**: Simple buttons for rolling the dice and resetting the game, with a dynamic interface for displaying results.
- **JavaFX Integration**: Utilizes JavaFX for rendering interactive components, including buttons, text fields, and images for dice.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The system immediately updates the displayed dice result when the user clicks the "Roll" button.
- **Random Number Generation**: Implements the use of random number generators to simulate realistic dice rolls.

## Methods Used:  
- **JavaFX**: Used JavaFX to create the GUI layout and handle event-driven programming, allowing for user interaction with buttons and input fields.
- **Event Handling**: Set up event handlers for the "Roll Dice" and "Reset Game" buttons to update the GUI and simulate the dice rolls.
- **Randomization**: Employed Javaâ€™s `Random` class to generate random numbers that simulate the rolling of dice.
- **Layout Management**: Used layout managers such as `VBox`, `HBox`, or `GridPane` to arrange the graphical elements in an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
- **Custom Dice Images**: (Optional) Used image files to visually represent the dice, creating a more immersive user experience.
- **Reset Functionality**: Implemented a reset feature to allow users to clear the results and reinitiate the dice roll with the same settings.
